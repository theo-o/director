Hi {{ user.full_name }},

You have just been added to a new website: {{ site.name }}. To view this website, visit {{ site.url }}. If you are having trouble accessing your website, please note that it can take some time to refresh the permissions for the folders. If it still doesn't work after half an hour, please email {{ contact_email }}.

Please keep in mind that our new system supports "dynamic" websites, such as Django, Flask, NodeJS, Jekyll, or Ruby on Rails, as well as PHP or static sites. To view and manage websites that you have access to, please visit https://director.tjhsst.edu.

Thanks,
The Director Team
